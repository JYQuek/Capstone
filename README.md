# Study of Airbnb in Singapore

Since its beginning in 2008, Airbnb revolutionised the accommodation industry and popularized the home-sharing concept. A recent statistics show that Airbnb currently has approximately 150 million users covering more than 65,000 cities. Airbnb's presence is strongly felt in Singapore as well, with close to 8,000 local listings currently. 

Hence, I decided to study the Airbnb data specific to the Singapore market and to gain insights on how Airbnb hosts can maximize their earnings through listing Airbnb. 

__Objectives of the study:__
  - Gain insights on Airbnb usage in Singapore
  - Identify key price determinants for Airbnb listings
  - Identify key areas of concerns from guests' feedback
  - Provide recommendations for Airbnb hosts to maximize earnings
  
__Models used for the study:__
  - Regression: Lasso, Ridge, RandomForest, XGBoost, Ensemble
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Bag of Words, Sentiment Analysis

I have uploaded my workings done on Jupyter Notebook, where you can find my codes and workings. There is also a PDF deck, if you would like to zoom in on the summary of my findings. 

Feel free to drop me a note if you have any questions on my findings or code!
